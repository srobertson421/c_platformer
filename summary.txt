=====================================================

This document summarizes the complete development process of a 2D physics-based 
platformer demo using Chipmunk2D physics engine and SDL2 for rendering.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
Created a fully functional physics-based platformer with:

MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PHASES
========================

1. INITIAL PHYSICS SETUP
-------------------------

- Created CMakeLists.txt and Makefile for cross-platform building
- Implemented basic physics world with gravity (-980 units/s²)
- Added static ground body and dynamic box physics
- Created initial red box rendering at 60 FPS

Key Features Added:
✓ Physics space initialization
✓ Gravity simulation
✓ Ground collision detection
✓ Basic box rendering with SDL2
✓ Build system configuration

2. MOUSE INTERACTION SYSTEM
----------------------------
- Implemented mouse input handling for spawning boxes
- Added support for up to 100 simultaneous physics bodies
- Created dynamic box creation at mouse click positions
- Enhanced rendering loop to handle multiple objects

Key Features Added:
✓ Left-click box spawning

3. DEBUG VISUALIZATION SYSTEM
------------------------------
- Added toggle-able debug visualization (F1 key)

- Created safe shape type detection system
- Added color-coded visualization (yellow=dynamic, green=static)

Key Features Added:
✓ Physics body outline rendering
✓ Shape type detection and filtering
✓ Keyboard toggle functionality
✓ Bounding box and vertex rendering

MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Fixed shape type detection crashes using safer APIs
- Resolved infinite jumping by excluding player's own shape from collision detection

4. PLATFORMER PLAYER CONTROLS
------------------------------
- Implemented WASD/Arrow key movement system
- Added physics-based horizontal movement with forces
- Created jump mechanics with ground detection
- Added movement state tracking and input handling

Key Features Added:
✓ Horizontal movement (A/D, Left/Right arrows)
✓ Jump controls (W/Up/Space) with ground detection
✓ Force-based movement with speed limiting
✓ Horizontal damping for better control
✓ Ground detection using ray casting

MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Fixed coordinate system flipping after collisions by using world coordinates
- Resolved excessive friction preventing ground movement
- Fixed infinite mid-air jumping with proper collision filtering

5. FRICTION AND MOVEMENT TUNING
--------------------------------
- Identified and resolved high friction issues
- Balanced movement forces and physics parameters
- Tuned ground detection sensitivity

Parameter Adjustments:
- Ground friction: 1.0f → 0.3f
- Player friction: 0.7f → 0.4f  
- Movement force: 500.0f → 1500.0f
- Max horizontal speed: 200.0f → 250.0f
- Jump impulse: 300.0f → 400.0f

6. ADVANCED COLLISION SYSTEM
-----------------------------
- Enhanced ground detection to work with any surface
- Implemented ray casting for multi-surface jumping
- Added collision filtering to prevent self-collision

Key Features Added:
✓ Jump on other boxes (not just ground)
✓ Ray casting collision detection
✓ Player shape filtering
✓ Support for complex surface interactions

7. SPRITE ANIMATION SYSTEM
---------------------------
- Designed comprehensive 2D sprite animation framework
- Added SDL2_image support for loading spritesheets
- Implemented state-based animation system
- Created animation timing and looping mechanisms

Animation Framework Components:
✓ SpriteFrame structure for frame coordinates
✓ Animation structure with timing and looping
✓ Sprite management with multiple animations
✓ State-driven animation switching (idle/walk/jump)

8. CHARACTER SPRITE INTEGRATION
--------------------------------
- Loaded real character spritesheet (assets/characters.png)
- Mapped 32x32 frames to correct animations
- Implemented horizontal sprite flipping for direction
- Added proper frame coordinate calculation

Sprite Features:
✓ Real character art instead of colored rectangles
✓ Frame-based walk animation (4 frames)
✓ Direction-aware sprite flipping
✓ Smooth animation timing (0.15s per frame)

COORDINATE FIXES:
- Corrected frame size from 16x16 to 32x32
- Fixed frame layout from vertical to horizontal progression
- Proper frame mapping: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)

9. SPRITE SCALING AND POSITIONING
----------------------------------
- Scaled sprite to match physics body (32x32 → 50x50)
- Enhanced sprite visibility (50x50 → 100x100)
- Aligned physics body with character's feet

Scaling Progression:
1. Native: 32x32 pixels
2. Physics-matched: 50x50 pixels  
3. Enhanced visibility: 100x100 pixels
4. Bottom-aligned: Physics body at character feet
